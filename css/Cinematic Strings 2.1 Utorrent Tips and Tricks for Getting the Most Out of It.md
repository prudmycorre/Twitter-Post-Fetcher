## What is Cinematic Strings 2.1?
 
Cinematic Strings 2.1 is an updated version of Cinematic Strings 2, which was released in 2012 by Cinematic Strings, a company founded by Alex Wallbank and David Hearn[^1^]. Cinematic Strings 2.1 is compatible with Kontakt Player, which means you don't need to own the full version of Kontakt to use it. You can also use it as a standalone product with no need for additional software[^3^].
 
Cinematic Strings 2.1 features a rich and warm sound that is ideal for creating realistic and expressive string parts for your music. It covers the full range of the string orchestra, from violins to basses, and includes various articulations such as spiccato, staccato, pizzicato, tremolo, trills, and more. You can also adjust the dynamics, vibrato, expression, and reverb using the intuitive interface[^1^].
 
One of the highlights of Cinematic Strings 2.1 is its legato engine, which automatically adjusts the transitions between notes based on your playing speed and style. This allows you to create smooth and natural melodies without worrying about tweaking parameters or modifying CC data. The legato engine also compensates for the different timbres of each string section, giving you a consistent and balanced sound[^1^].
 
Another feature that sets Cinematic Strings 2.1 apart from other string libraries is its "mix" microphone position, which combines the close, stage, and room microphones into one balanced signal. This gives you a full and lush sound while saving on computer resources. You can also use the individual microphone positions to fine-tune the sound to your liking[^1^].
 
Cinematic Strings 2.1 also offers two ensemble patches â Full Ensemble and Lite Ensemble â which are perfect for sketching out ideas or quickly filling out a track while saving on RAM. These patches include all the articulations and microphone positions of the individual sections, but with fewer samples loaded[^1^].
